# WeegieNights

WeegieNights
============

Guide our hero, Ned, through a boozy night out in Glasgow. Keep him in "the
zone" to keep him out longer - if he gets too drunk or too sober, he'll have to
go home. Spend your cash wisely, buy booze and food to balance Ned's
drunkenness and help him last the distance. Keep in mind different
establishments will have different opening hours, and watch out for the
unsavoury characters roaming the streets, ready to put an end to Ned's night.

This is the Scottish Amiga Users Group entry into the 2022 Amiga Blitz Basic
Game Jam, and should probably be considered a work in progress. Further updates
will be released as and when they happen.
